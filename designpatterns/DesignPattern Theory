Factory Pattern:
- creates object without exposing the instantiation logic to the client
- refers to the newly created object through a common interface

Singletone pattern:
- ensure that only one instance of a class is created
- provide a global point of access to the object
- the implementation involves a static member in the singletone class, a private constructor and a static public method that returns reference to the static member.


Structural :
	1.Decorator: the intent of this pattern is to add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object
	
Behavioural:

1.chain if responsibility:
- we can say that each receiver contains reference of another receiver.
- if one object can not handle handle the request then it passes the same to the next receiver and so on.

Iterator:


J2EE Design Pattern:
	There are 3 types
	1.Presentation Layer:
		a.Intercepting Filter Layer
		b.Front Controller
	2.Business Layer
		a.Business Delegate
		b.Transfer object
	3.Integration Layer
		a.Data Access Object(DAO)


Q.
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given input as integer array in which consecutive elements should have a difference of 4 or more than 4.

If the above condition matches display “1” else “0”

Input and Output Format :
First line of input consists of n, the number of elements. Next n lines correspond to the array elements. Output consist of an integer, which is the either 1 or 0

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative numbers available in the input array and terminate the program.

Sample Input 1:
6
1
5
10
6
2
7

Sample Output 1:
1

Sample Input 2:
-8

Sample Output 2:
Invalid array size
























Q.
Ram needs to pay the school fees of his 6 year old kid. As he is busy with his work, he is not finding time to go to the school to make payment. 
His kid's school doesn't accept online payment. So he decided to send the fee amount through his kid. 
The available denominations of rupees or coins is 500, 100, 50, 10, 5 and 1. 
Can you write a program to find the minimal number of coins or notes to be given to his kid?
 
Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a single integer that corresponds to the fee amount to be paid.
Output consists of an integer that corresponds to the minimal number of coins or rupee notes.
 
Print Invalid Input if the input value is negative.
 
 Sample Input 1:
682
 
Sample Output 1:
8
 

Sample Input 2:
-2345
 
Sample Output 2:
Invalid Input






























Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Write a program to check if the first and middle element in an array is the same, if so display “100” in output or else display the first element of the array.

Note: Array size is always odd.

Input and Output Format :
The first line of the input consists of an integer, n that corresponds to the number of elements in the array.
The next 'n' lines correspond to the elements in the array.

1) Print "Invalid array size" when size of the array is a negative number and terminate the program.
2) Print "Invalid input" when there is any negative numbers available in the input array and terminate the program.
3) Print "Size must be odd" when the size of the array is even.

Sample Input 1:
7
8
4
5
8
3
2
1

Sample Output 1:
100

Sample Input 2:
10
4
5
6
-8

Sample Output 2:
Invalid input

Sample Input 3:
3
4
8
6

Sample Output 3:
4



Q.
Read the question carefully and follow the input and output format.

Given a number n, count the occurences of a number,x in n.

Input and Output Format :
The first line of the input consists of an integer n, the second line consists of an integer, which is the digit whose occurence is to be calculated. 
Output is an integer that gives the count.

Print "Number too small" if any of the 2 input numbers is less than 0 and terminate the program.
Print "Number too large" if any of the 2 input numbers is greater than 32767 and terminate the program.

Sample Input 1:
1122
1
Sample Output 1:
2


Sample Input 2:
-2134
Sample Output 2:
Number too small
